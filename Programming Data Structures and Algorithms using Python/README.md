# Programming Data Structures and Algorithms using Python

**COURSE LAYOUT**

Week 1

Informal introduction to programming, algorithms and data structures via gcd
Downloading and installing Python
gcd in Python: variables, operations, control flow - assignments, conditionals, loops, functions

Week 2\
Python: types, expressions, strings, lists, tuples
Python memory model: names, mutable and immutable values
List operations: slices etc
Binary search
Inductive function definitions: numerical and structural induction
Elementary inductive sorting: selection and insertion sort
In-place sorting

Week 3\
Basic algorithmic analysis: input size, asymptotic complexity, O() notation
Arrays vs lists
Merge sort
Quicksort
Stable sorting

Week 4\
Dictionaries
More on Python functions: optional arguments, default values
Passing functions as arguments
Higher order functions on lists: map, filter, list comprehension

Week 5\
Exception handling
Basic input/output
Handling files
String processing

Week 6\
Backtracking: N Queens, recording all solutions
Scope in Python: local, global, non local names
Nested functions
Data structures: stack, queue
Heaps

Week 7\
Abstract datatypes
Classes and objects in Python
"Linked" lists: find, insert, delete
Binary search trees: find, insert, delete
Height-balanced binary search trees

Week 8\
Efficient evaluation of recursive definitions: memorization
Dynamic programming: examples
Other programming languages: C and manual memory management
Other programming paradigms: functional programming
